## 👋 About This Project

**Hey there!** I'm a hobbyist developer who built this for my dad. He used to manage his small retail business with stacks of paper, handwritten ledgers, and what seemed like an endless supply of coffee to stay organized. As his tech-savvy son, I decided to modernize his workflow and give him the digital tools he deserves.

This isn't just another business management app - it's a labor of love designed specifically for small businesses that want to ditch the paperwork and embrace the future.
