# Code Structure Explained

- `src/components/` â€” Contains React components for each feature (customers, sales, payments, dashboard, etc.).
- `src/utils/pdfGenerator.ts` â€” Generates PDF reports for customers using jsPDF and autotable.
- `src/hooks/` â€” Custom React hooks (e.g., authentication).
- `src/lib/` â€” Supabase client setup and helpers.
- `src/types/` â€” TypeScript type definitions for data models.
- `database/` â€” SQL files for database schema and sample data.
- `docs/` â€” Project documentation and guides.

# Example: Generating a Customer PDF Report

The PDF generator takes customer, payment, and sales data and creates a professional statement:

```typescript
import { generateCustomerReport } from './utils/pdfGenerator';

// Usage
await generateCustomerReport(customer, payments, sales);
```
- The function creates a PDF with customer details, summary, purchase history, and payment history.
- Uses jsPDF and jspdf-autotable for layout and formatting.
