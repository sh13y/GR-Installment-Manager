Welcome to the GR Installment Manager! Say goodbye to mountains of paper, misplaced ledgers, and the headache of manual tracking. This is a modern, tailor-made business management system designed to make running an installment-based sales business as easy as pie. Or, in this case, as easy as selling tires.

### A Note from the Developer (The "Why")

This project is a special one. I built it for my dad, who, for the longest time, managed his entire tire business with just pen, paper, and a whole lot of patience. As a hobbyist and a son, I saw his hard work and knew there had to be a better, simpler way for him to manage everything.

This system is the result of that idea: a tool to bring his business into the digital age, save him countless hours, and let him focus on what he does best. From paper to pixels, this one's for you, Dad!
